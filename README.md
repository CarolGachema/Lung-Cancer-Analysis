# Lung Cancer Project

This repository contains code and scripts for analyzing lung cancer gene expression data.

## Data

The raw GSE expression data is **too large to upload** here. You can download it directly from NCBI GEO:

[GSE19188](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE19188)


Place the downloaded file in a folder called `data/` before running the scripts.
